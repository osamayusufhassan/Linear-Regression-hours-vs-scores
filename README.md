# Prediction of Student Test Scores
• Problem Statement: Create a model to predict the test scores of a class.<br />
• Skills Accomplished: Python, sci-kit learn (Linear Regression, train_test_split), Model Evaluation using various metrics (mean absolute error, mean squared error, RMS and R-squared).<br />
• Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook for Python, Microsoft Excel.<br />
• Trained a Linear Regression model to predict the test scores achieved by a student based upon respective hours of study.<br />
• Achieved an R-2 score =0.945 as a measure of goodness of fit of the model.Predictive modelling via Linear Regression to predict score achieved by a student based upon hours of study
